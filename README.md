# Amazon Vine Analysis
The general purpose of this analysis is to look into the Amazon Vine program and determine if the reviews left for products accurately reflect the overall reviews of the products.

## What is Amazon Vine?
Amazon Vine is a paid program where customers are paid a small amount for every product they review.

The goal of the program is to increase product reviews on Amazon, however, the program isn't without controversy. Are products rated higher if the person leaving the review has a monetary stake in the review?

## Software Analysis
Looking specifically at software reviews, the Vine program does tend to skew higher in the reviews.

| |Total Reviews|5-Star Reviews|Percentage|
|-|-|-|-|
|Non-Paid|17,514|5,154|29.4%|
|Vine|248|102|41.1%|
|Total|17,762|5,256|30.0%|

## Positivity Bias
Specifically within the software category, there's a fairly high positivity bias with paid, Vine reviews. Only slightly over one quarter of the standard, non-paid reviews rate the products as 5-stars, versus over 40% of the paid reviews.

Analysis of one specific product should also take into consideration other locations for purchase. There's possibility of greater, non-paid reviews on individual manufacturer or developer sites, by individuals more adept to using different softwares. Amazon purchasers may be using a search engine where Amazon ranks highest, leading them to purchase a product they're unfamiliar with, with no additional support.
